# Current State and Next Steps

**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**PR Merged:** #40 - Interactive Character Sheet with Improved Dice Tray and Race Selection Foundation  
**Branch:** Ready to start from `main`

## 🎉 What We Just Completed

### ✅ Major Accomplishments

1. **Interactive Character Sheet Paradigm**
   - ✅ Completely replaced wizard-based character creation with interactive character sheet
   - ✅ Fixed dice tray spacing with proper visual separators and padding
   - ✅ Eliminated problematic modal/wizard components causing fuzzy screens and white boxes
   - ✅ Created smooth, direct character creation flow

2. **RaceSelectionModal Foundation**
   - ✅ Built complete `RaceSelectionModal` component with carousel interface
   - ✅ Added 9 D&D races with full descriptions, traits, and ability score increases
   - ✅ Implemented left/right navigation with proper state management
   - ✅ Ready for API integration (currently uses placeholder data)

3. **Technical Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Added `showResult` prop to DiceRoller for better layout control
   - ✅ Fixed all TypeScript strict compilation errors for CI
   - ✅ Improved `ci-checks` script to match CI exactly
   - ✅ Added comprehensive design documentation (DDR-001, DDR-002)

4. **Design Documentation**
   - ✅ DDR-001: Interactive Character Sheet Paradigm decision
   - ✅ DDR-002: Current Focus and Goals planning
   - ✅ Journey document capturing architectural breakthrough

## 🚧 Current State

### What's Working

- Interactive character sheet with clean layout
- Dice rolling with 4d6 drop lowest mechanics
- Drag and drop ability score assignment
- Race selection modal (not wired up yet)
- Proper theme integration and responsive design
- All CI checks passing

### What Needs Work

- Race/Class selection sections are placeholder (just set to Human/Fighter hardcoded)
- RaceSelectionModal is not connected to the character sheet clicks
- ClassSelectionModal doesn't exist yet
- No connection to real D&D 5e API data
- Skills, background, and equipment sections are basic placeholders

## 🎯 Next Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)

### 1. **Wire Up Race Selection Modal** (High Priority)

- **File**: `src/character/creation/InteractiveCharacterSheet.tsx`
- **Task**: Connect race section click to open `RaceSelectionModal`
- **Details**: Import RaceSelectionModal, add state for modal visibility, wire up onClick handlers
- **Success Criteria**: Click on race section → modal opens → select race → modal closes → race displays

### 2. **Create ClassSelectionModal** (High Priority)

- **File**: Create `src/character/creation/ClassSelectionModal.tsx`
- **Task**: Build similar carousel modal for D&D classes
- **Details**: Copy RaceSelectionModal pattern, add class data (Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, etc.)
- **Success Criteria**: Class modal with same UX as race modal

### 3. **Wire Up Class Selection Modal** (High Priority)

- **File**: `src/character/creation/InteractiveCharacterSheet.tsx`
- **Task**: Connect class section click to open `ClassSelectionModal`
- **Details**: Same pattern as race modal integration
- **Success Criteria**: Click on class section → modal opens → select class → modal closes → class displays

### 4. **API Integration** (Medium Priority)

- **Task**: Replace hardcoded race/class data with real D&D 5e API calls
- **Context**: User specifically requested "no hardcoded data except when prototyping"
- **API**: Connect to existing `/home/kirk/personal/dnd5e-api` local library
- **Success Criteria**: Race and class data loaded from API, not hardcoded arrays

## 🔧 Technical Notes for Future Development

### Key Files and Locations

```
src/character/creation/
├── InteractiveCharacterSheet.tsx    # Main character sheet (wire modals here)
├── RaceSelectionModal.tsx           # Complete, ready to wire up
└── ClassSelectionModal.tsx          # Needs to be created

docs/design-decisions/
├── DDR-001-interactive-character-sheet-paradigm.md
└── DDR-002-current-focus-and-goals.md
```

### Important Patterns Established

1. **Modal Pattern**: Use AnimatePresence + motion.div for modal overlays
2. **Carousel Pattern**: Left/right arrows with index state management
3. **Selection Pattern**: Store selection in character state, close modal on select
4. **Data Pattern**: Structured objects with id, name, emoji, description, traits, etc.

### CI and Local Development

```bash
# Run exact same checks as CI (now includes build)
npm run ci-checks

# If CI fails, reproduce locally
rm -rf node_modules && npm ci && npm run ci-checks

# Check PR status
gh pr checks
```

### Known Technical Debt

- Dice roll result shows below button (acceptable for now, will fix in popup dice tray)
- Large bundle size warning (can be addressed later with code splitting)
- RaceSelectionModal has hardcoded data (intentional for prototyping)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### TypeScript Strict Compilation

- `tsc -b` (build) is stricter than `tsc --noEmit` (typecheck)
- For Framer Motion drag events, use `e as unknown as React.DragEvent`
- Always test with `npm run build` not just `npm run typecheck`

### Drag and Drop with Framer Motion

- Use proper type casting for dataTransfer access
- Cast currentTarget as HTMLDivElement for style access
- Test drag events thoroughly with strict TypeScript

### Character Creation UX

- Interactive character sheet paradigm is much better than wizard
- Direct manipulation feels more like D&D than forms
- Visual separation (borders, padding) is crucial for dice tray usability

## 🚀 Success Criteria for Next Session

### Minimum Viable Goals

1. Click race section → RaceSelectionModal opens
2. Select race → modal closes and race displays in character sheet
3. Click class section → ClassSelectionModal opens
4. Select class → modal closes and class displays in character sheet

### Stretch Goals

1. Connect to real D&D 5e API for race/class data
2. Add loading states for API calls
3. Handle API errors gracefully
4. Add more races/classes to the data sets

## 📂 Next Session Startup Commands

```bash
# Start fresh from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feat/race-class-modal-integration

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run ci-checks before committing
npm run ci-checks
```
