# DDR-002: Current Focus and Goals

**Status**: Active  
**Date**: 2025-07-16  
**Deciders**: Team

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to clarify our current focus and goals to avoid scope creep and ensure we deliver a cohesive, polished experience.

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working

- âœ… Interactive character sheet paradigm established
- âœ… Animated dice rolling functionality
- âœ… Basic character sheet layout and styling
- âœ… Real-time character summary updates
- âœ… Theme system and visual design

### What Needs Work

- ðŸš§ Race/Class selection is placeholder (just sets to Human/Fighter)
- ðŸš§ Missing skills, background, and equipment sections
- ðŸš§ No connection to real D&D 5e API data
- ðŸš§ Character persistence and draft saving

## Decision: Current Focus Areas

### Primary Goal: Complete Interactive Character Sheet MVP

**Focus Area 1: Core Character Sheet Layout** (Current Priority)

- Polish the main character sheet interface
- Ensure proper responsive layout
- Refine spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Make the sheet feel like a real D&D character sheet

**Focus Area 2: Essential Sections Implementation**

- Race selection with proper modal interface
- Class selection with proper modal interface
- Skills and background selection
- Basic equipment/inventory display

**Focus Area 3: Data Integration**

- Connect to real D&D 5e API for races, classes, etc.
- Replace placeholder data with actual game content
- Implement character draft persistence

### Secondary Goals (Later Phases)

- Advanced animations and feedback
- Collaborative features
- Template and preset systems
- Search and discovery features

## Time Allocation Decision

**60% Layout and UX Polish** - Getting the main interface right
**30% Core Functionality** - Race/class/skills implementation  
**10% Data Integration** - API connections and persistence

## Success Criteria

A user should be able to:

1. Click "Create Character" and see a beautiful character sheet
2. Roll dice for ability scores with satisfying animations
3. Click on race/class sections to make meaningful choices
4. See their character build in real-time
5. Complete a basic character and "Begin Adventure"

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. **Layout Polish**: Improve character sheet visual design and spacing
2. **Race Modal**: Implement proper race selection with actual D&D races
3. **Class Modal**: Implement proper class selection with actual D&D classes
4. **Skills Section**: Add skills and background selection
5. **Equipment Section**: Add basic starting equipment display

## Out of Scope (For Now)

- Complex character optimization tools
- Advanced rulebook integration
- Multiplayer/collaborative features
- Character import/export
- Custom race/class creation
