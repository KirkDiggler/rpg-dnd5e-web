**Deciders**: Team

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide on the core UX paradigm for character creation in our D&D 5e web application. Traditional character creation uses multi-step wizards, but this doesn't match how D&D players actually think about character building.

## Decision Drivers

- **User Mental Model**: D&D players think in terms of character sheets, not forms
- **Non-linear Workflow**: Players want to jump between different aspects (roll stats first, then pick race, name last, etc.)
- **Immediate Feedback**: Players want to see their character building in real-time
- **Familiar Interface**: Character sheet layout is universally understood by D&D players

## Considered Options

1. **Traditional Wizard Flow** - Step-by-step form progression
2. **Single Page Form** - All options on one scrollable page
3. **Interactive Character Sheet** - Click on sheet sections to make choices

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: Interactive Character Sheet

### Implementation Details

- **Main Interface**: Character sheet layout with clickable sections
- **Dice Integration**: Real animated dice for ability score rolling
- **Modal Overlays**: Detailed choice screens appear when clicking sections
- **Real-time Updates**: Character summary updates as choices are made
- **Flexible Order**: Users can complete sections in any order

### Positive Consequences

- Intuitive UX that matches D&D mental models
- Supports non-linear character building workflows
- Engaging and interactive experience
- Easy to understand at a glance

### Negative Consequences

- More complex to implement than traditional forms
- Requires careful state management
- Need to handle incomplete character states gracefully

## Implementation Status

- âœ… Basic character sheet layout
- âœ… Animated dice rolling for ability scores
- âœ… Real-time character summary
- ðŸš§ Race/Class selection modals
- ðŸš§ Skills and background sections
- ðŸš§ Equipment and inventory sections

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper race/class selection modals
2. Add remaining character sheet sections
3. Connect to real D&D 5e API data
4. Add character persistence and draft saving
