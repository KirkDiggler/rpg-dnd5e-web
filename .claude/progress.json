      "notes": "Implemented core hex math module using cube coordinates as single source of truth. Added cubeToWorld (hex to render position), worldToCube (click to hex with axial rounding), and hexDistance. Configured vitest and wrote comprehensive test suite (15 tests, all passing). All pre-commit checks pass."
