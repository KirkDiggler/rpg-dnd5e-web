## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Game State Management

```typescript
interface GameIntegrationState {
  campaign: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    currentSession: Session;
    participants: Player[];
    worldState: WorldState;
  };

  liveSession: {
    active: boolean;
    sessionId: string;
    participants: SessionParticipant[];
    turnOrder: string[];
    currentTurn: string;
    combatState: CombatState;
  };

  character: {
    baseCharacter: Character;
    currentState: CharacterState;
    progressionHistory: ProgressionEvent[];
    inventory: InventoryState;
    resources: ResourceState;
  };

  analytics: {
    characterMetrics: CharacterMetrics;
    sessionHistory: SessionHistory[];
    optimizationSuggestions: Suggestion[];
  };
}
```

### Real-time Communication

```typescript
interface GameSocket {
  // Session Management
  joinSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>;
  leaveSession(): Promise<void>;

  // Character Updates
  updateCharacter(updates: CharacterUpdate): Promise<void>;
  syncCharacterState(state: CharacterState): Promise<void>;

  // Combat Actions
  rollDice(roll: DiceRoll): Promise<DiceResult>;
  performAction(action: CombatAction): Promise<ActionResult>;
  updateInitiative(initiative: Initiative[]): Promise<void>;

  // Communication
  sendMessage(message: ChatMessage): Promise<void>;
  shareHandout(handout: Handout): Promise<void>;

  // Map & Positioning
  updatePosition(position: Position): Promise<void>;
  updateMapState(mapState: MapState): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Progressive Web App Features
