# RPG D&D 5e Web

A web-based D&D 5e game interface designed to run as a Discord Activity, providing a rich visual experience for turn-based gameplay.

- Character creation and management
- Turn-based combat with visual board
- Integration with Discord for multiplayer sessions
- Rich, game-like UI with animations and effects

## Tech Stack

### ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Pre-Push CI Checks

**ALWAYS run CI checks before pushing:**

```bash
npm run ci-check  # Run this BEFORE git push
```

We have multiple safeguards in place:

1. **Pre-push hook** - Automatically runs CI checks when you `git push`
2. **Safe push script** - Use `./scripts/safe-push.sh` or `git safepush`
3. **CI check script** - Quick local CI validation with `npm run ci-check`

#### Quick Commands

```bash
# Check if your code will pass CI
npm run ci-check

# Auto-fix common issues
npm run ci-fix

# Safe push with automatic checks
git safepush origin feature-branch
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```
