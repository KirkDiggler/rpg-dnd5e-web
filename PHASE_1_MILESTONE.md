- Rarity-based visual styling and hover animations
- Selected and disabled states
- Click handlers for selection and detail modal
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility support
- Loading and error states

**Props API:**

```typescript
interface ChoiceCardProps {
  id: string | number;
  type: 'race' | 'class' | 'background';
  title: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  preview?: string;
  image?: string;
  rarity?: 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'epic' | 'legendary';
  selected?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
  loading?: boolean;
  onClick?: (id: string | number) => void;
  onDetailClick?: (id: string | number) => void;
}
```

### 2. Create DetailModal Component with Carousel

**Priority: High**
**Labels: enhancement, component, ui, modal**

Full-screen modal displaying detailed information about character options with carousel for browsing between options.

**Requirements:**

- Full-screen overlay with smooth animations
- Horizontal carousel with touch/swipe support
- Hero image, detailed description, mechanics section
- Features list with expand/collapse
- Navigation controls and keyboard support
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

**Props API:**

```typescript
interface DetailModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  items: OptionItem[];
  currentIndex: number;
  onIndexChange: (index: number) => void;
  onSelect: (item: OptionItem) => void;
  type: 'race' | 'class' | 'background';
}
```

### 3. Create AnimatedStat Component

**Priority: High**
**Labels: enhancement, component, ui, animation**

Animated component for displaying ability scores with smooth transitions, bonus indicators, and visual feedback.

**Requirements:**

- Circular or card-based stat display
- Number count-up animation when value changes
- Bonus/penalty slide-in animations
- Glow effect for modified stats
- Click for bonus breakdown, hover tooltip
- Loading shimmer for undefined values

**Props API:**

```typescript
interface AnimatedStatProps {
  ability: 'STR' | 'DEX' | 'CON' | 'INT' | 'WIS' | 'CHA';
  baseValue?: number;
  bonuses: StatBonus[];
  highlight?: boolean;
  loading?: boolean;
  showModifier?: boolean;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
}
```

### 4. Create TraitBadge Component

**Priority: Medium**
**Labels: enhancement, component, ui**

Visual component for displaying character traits, features, and abilities as attractive badges.

**Requirements:**

- Compact badge format with icon and text
- Color coding by trait type (racial, class, background, feat)
- Rarity-based styling and hover states
- Click to select/deselect, hover tooltip
- Animation effects for appearance/removal

**Props API:**

```typescript
interface TraitBadgeProps {
  trait: Trait;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  variant?: 'default' | 'compact' | 'detailed';
  showSource?: boolean;
  clickable?: boolean;
  selected?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
  onSelect?: (trait: Trait) => void;
}
```

### 5. Create Character Builder Context and State Management

**Priority: High**
**Labels: enhancement, state-management, context**

React context and hooks for managing character creation state, including draft synchronization, section navigation, and preview mode.

**Requirements:**

- CharacterCreationProvider context
- useCharacterBuilder hook for state management
- Section navigation with validation
- Preview mode for trying options without committing
- Optimistic updates with server sync
- Error handling and retry logic

**Context API:**

```typescript
interface CharacterBuilderState {
  draft: CharacterDraft;
  ui: {
    selectedSection: Section;
    modalOpen: boolean;
    carouselIndex: number;
    previewMode: boolean;
  };
  selections: {
    race: { viewing: number; selected: number };
    class: { viewing: number; selected: number };
  };
  pendingUpdates: Partial<CharacterDraft>;
}
```

### 6. Update Character Creation Wizard to Use New Components

**Priority: Medium**
**Labels: enhancement, refactor, integration**

Refactor existing CharacterCreationWizard to use new interactive components while maintaining existing functionality.

**Requirements:**

- Replace dropdown race/class selection with ChoiceCard grids
- Integrate DetailModal for option exploration
- Update ability score display to use AnimatedStat
- Maintain existing API integration
- Preserve accessibility and mobile support
- Smooth migration path from current implementation

### 7. Create Interactive Character Sheet Component

**Priority: Medium**
**Labels: enhancement, component, ui**

Enhanced character sheet that serves as a live preview during character creation.

**Requirements:**

- Real-time updates as selections change
- AnimatedStat integration for ability scores
- TraitBadge lists for features and traits
- Collapsible sections for organization
- Highlight new/changed elements
- Print-friendly styling option

### 8. Add Theme System Support for New Components
