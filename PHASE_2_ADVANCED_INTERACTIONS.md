## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### State Management Enhancements

```typescript
interface AdvancedBuilderState extends CharacterBuilderState {
  comparison: {
    activeComparison: boolean;
    items: ComparisonItem[];
    criteria: ComparisonCriteria[];
  };
  search: {
    query: string;
    filters: FilterSet;
    results: SearchResult[];
    savedSearches: SavedSearch[];
  };
  templates: {
    availableTemplates: Template[];
    appliedTemplate?: Template;
    customTemplates: Template[];
  };
  collaboration: {
    sessionId?: string;
    participants: Participant[];
    permissions: Permission[];
  };
}
```

### API Extensions

```typescript
interface AdvancedBuilderAPI {
  // Search & Discovery
  searchOptions(query: string, filters: FilterSet): Promise<SearchResult[]>;
  saveSearch(search: SavedSearch): Promise<void>;

  // Templates
  getTemplates(category?: string): Promise<Template[]>;
  createTemplate(template: Template): Promise<Template>;
  applyTemplate(templateId: string): Promise<CharacterDraft>;

  // Collaboration
  createSession(): Promise<CollaborationSession>;
  joinSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>;
  shareCharacter(characterId: string): Promise<ShareableLink>;

  // Recommendations
  getRecommendations(context: BuilderContext): Promise<Recommendation[]>;
  recordChoice(choice: Choice): Promise<void>;
}
```
